> [!CAUTION]
> **This software is in VERY, and I really mean VERY early stage of development!** It still doesn't have the most basic features and could even not work at all. It is basically unusable for now, because there isn't even what to use at this stage.

> [!WARNING]
> **Be prepared for a firestorm!** I ([krystejj](https://github.com/krystejj)) am still learning to code in Svelte. That means there can be major and really basic bugs in my code. While I am expanding my experience with Svelte and learning new things, be aware that you may find even most basic mistakes here. You can always create a pull request or issue in this repo when you find or encounter any error, all help is always appreciated.

**Klark Svelte Frontend** is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) web frontend for the [Klark Server](https://github.com/krystejj/klark-server). It is modern, stunning, powerful and easy to use. Because of usage of Svelte, it is also very fast and lightweight. All of this free and open-source.
