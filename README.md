> [!CAUTION]
> **This software is in VERY, and I really mean VERY early stage of development!** It still doesn't have the most basic features and could even not work at all. It is basically unusable for now, because there isn't even what to use at this stage.

> [!WARNING]
> **Be prepared for a firestorm!** I ([krystejj](https://github.com/krystejj)) am still learning to code in Svelte. That means there can be major and really basic bugs in my code. While I am expanding my experience with Svelte and learning new things, be aware that you may find even most basic mistakes here. You can always create a pull request or issue in this repo when you find or encounter any error, all help is always appreciated.

Klark Svelte Frontend is a web frontend (client) written in [the Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/), created for [Klark Server](https://github.com/krystejj/klark-server). It is designed with modernity in mind, which also applies for ease of use for you and makes UI look stunning. Because of usage of Svelte, it is also very fast and lightweight. And all of this open-source, of course.
